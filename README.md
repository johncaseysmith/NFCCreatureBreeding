The beginnings of an Android game written in 16 hours that won a Georgia Tech Mobile Application Development App-a-thon. Art and creatures done by Caroline Cash (http://carolinecash.com), UI and general direction by Kelly Snyder (http://kelly-snyder.com), and code written by me.

When the app is started up, a creature is created consisting of any five different parts: water, forest, desert, grass, and fire. The creature can then be breed with another creature on someone else's phone through the NFC protocol to create an entirely new creature consisting of a combination of the parts of its parents. We hope to continue this idea and make a full-fledged game with breeding and caretaking mechanics.

Images of the creatures can be seen at http://imgur.com/a/4NdMY and in the Creatures folder.
